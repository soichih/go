WHAT IS GO?

Do you often type something like.. "cd ../../../foo/dir/dir" in order 
to navigate to the directory back and forth? Instead, you can use "g". 

When you install "go", you can type "g" on your command prompt which 
will list commonly visited directories. You can then select the path 
you want to go to, and boom! you will be there!!

INSTALLATION

1. Download go package. Install it wherever you want.
2. Add following to your ~/.bashrc

. /go-installation-dir/go.source

3. Re-login to your shell, or re-source your .bashrc


USING GO

From the command line, type "g". You will see a list of default
directory. Navigating inside g is somewhat similar to nativeting in 
vi. In order to exit, type "q". To go up and down in the list, use
j(up) or k(down). If you want to expand a certain path, move to the
path and type l(left). It will list all child directories. In order 
to go to the parent directory, type h(right).

When you want to jump to the directory, hit enter. You will be 
automatically move to the location. g will also execute a command
specified in the "source" file. Default is "ls". 

If you want to remove a directory from the list, just type x on the
item. If you want to edit the list itself, you can open ~/.gofilepath
file and edit the list.

`g` will automatically add directy that you are gone to by hitting 
enter key to the directory list.

If you need to add a path manually to the list, you can simplly edit ~/.gopath
